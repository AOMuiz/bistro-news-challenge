      <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
      <p>posted by BGB,November 15, 2016</p>
      <p>This week i am <i>exremely</i> excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide.</em> In <em>sous vide</em> cooking,you submerge the food(usually vaccum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target tempreture you want the foodto be cooked to.
        In his book, <em>cooking for geeks,</em>Jeff potter describes it as<q>ultra-low temperature poaching.</q></p> 
      <p>Next month,we will be serving<b> <i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before november 30.</p>
